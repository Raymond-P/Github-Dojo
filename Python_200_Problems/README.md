# 200 Python Problems!
The are a total of 200 python exercises to be completed from a
[free Udemy course.](https://www.udemy.com/python-handon/)

## Testing!
As a personal addition to these exercises, all problems must be tested using
the [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) module or some other sort of testing suite. I am still learning
how to properly test python programs, so unittest will have to do for now.
